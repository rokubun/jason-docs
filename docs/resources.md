# Resources

This section includes a list of resources related to GNSS data that you might
find useful, should you require further information.

## Glossary

|:---|:------|
|broadcast ephemeris|is the set of data delivered by the GNSS satellite such as satellite orbits and clocks that are required to compute the position|
|convergence time| time that the navigation filter needs to reach a target accuracy in the position solution|
|formal error| error estimate of the navigation filter
|GNSS raw measurements| The set of measurements (pseudorange and carrier phase) generated by a GNSS receiver, used to compute the navigation solution|
|navigation filter| is the mathematical engine that implements a given [strategy](../strategies) in order to estimate the |

We'd rather have you using our service to compute position, but should you
want to explore other services, here there is a list of them, that perform PPP,
in case you want to try them out:
