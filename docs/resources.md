# Resources

This section includes a list of resources related to GNSS data that you might
find useful, should you require further information.

## Glossary

|:---|:------|
|broadcast ephemeris|is the set of data delivered by the GNSS satellite such as satellite orbits and clocks that are required to compute the position|
|convergence time| time that the navigation filter needs to reach a target accuracy in the position solution|
|formal error| error estimate of the navigation filter
|GNSS raw measurements| The set of measurements (pseudorange and carrier phase) generated by a GNSS receiver, used to compute the navigation solution|
|navigation filter| is the mathematical engine that implements a given [strategy](../strategies) in order to estimate the |

## External links

There is a list of external links and references you might find handy:

- ESA's [Navipedia](https://gssc.esa.int/navipedia/index.php/Main_Page) page.
- UPC's [gAGE Course on GNSS data processing](https://gage.upc.edu/forum/gnss-books/)
- GPS service daemon software [gpsd](https://gpsd.gitlab.io/gpsd/index.html)
- [RTKlib](http://rtklib.com/), an open-source GNSS data processing software

We'd rather have you using our service to compute position, but should you
want to explore other services, here there is a list of them, that perform PPP,
in case you want to try them out:

- JPL's [Automatic Precise Positioning Service](http://apps.gdgps.net/)
- NRCan's [PPP service](https://webapp.geod.nrcan.gc.ca/geod/tools-outils/ppp.php)
- Geoscience Australia [positioning service](http://www.ga.gov.au/bin/gps.pl)
- GMV's [magicGNSS service](https://magicgnss.gmv.com/)
