# Jason usage

## Single receiver

The most basic usage is using data from a single GNSS receiver

## Using a base station

If the area you are surveying does not have a nearby CORS station, you can use
your own reference GNSS receiver. During the campaign make sure you collect
data at the same time as your rover and then process the rover GNSS data together
with the GNSS data from the base station.
